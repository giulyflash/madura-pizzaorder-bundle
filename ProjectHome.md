This delivers a bundled sub application to serve as an example that plugs into madura-perspectives-manager.

It is based on the same ideas as madura-pizzaorder, but all we have here is the pizza configuration.

The result is a jar file that can be plugged into madura-perspectives-manager dynamically, ie you can add or upgrade the pizza order bundle to the madura-perspectives-manager without having to restart it.

The UI uses Vaadin technology and the bundling is handled by madura-bundles.
